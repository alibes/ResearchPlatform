            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p>
              At Research Agora, we believe that a change in how research is shared and assessed must take place. New research assessment agreements like <span className='bold'>DORA</span> and <span className='bold'>CoARA</span> advocate for a more open and collaborative research culture that takes into account all research outputs, from publications to science outreach and open science policies.
            </p>
            <p>
            We aim to provide a platform that will help you showcase your achievements as a researcher, but also to provide a forum to share your research, initiate collaborations and create an active community in which research integrity and reproducibility are the core values.
            </p>
